# Customers Segmentation system


Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. With the help of clustering techniques, B2C (Business to customers) companies can identify the several segments of customers that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and income, habits...This will allow us to target the potential user base.

In this  Project, I will perform one of the most essential applications of machine learning â€“ Customer Segmentation. In this project, I will implement customer segmentation in python. Whenever you need to find your best customer, customer segmentation is the ideal methodology.
